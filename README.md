NixOS configs for a store, containing two locations and multiple hosts. To be combined into one single NixOS config with multiple hosts to deploy near-identical NixOS systems to multiple hosts for something a little more sophisticated. 

Initial systems deployed using [nixos-anywhere](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-anywhere) using [disko]](https://github.com/nix-community/disko)
and [nixos-facter](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-facter).
